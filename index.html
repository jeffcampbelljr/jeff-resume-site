    <h2>The Spark</h2>
    <p>AmeriCommerce had no sales team, no systems, and an underused partner network. I was the only one in sales. I listened to what customers were asking for — better integrations, smoother handoffs, and real tech relationships. That’s when I realized: partnerships weren’t just helpful — they were *strategic*.</p>

  <section class="chapter">
    <h2>The Climb</h2>
    <p>I built out a custom Salesforce system with full automation. I drove direct sales. I landed a partnership that brought over 9,000 stores to the platform. When the acquisition came, I celebrated with the team over Zoom. It felt like validation — we took something no one wanted and made it best-in-class.</p>

  <section class="chapter dark">
    <h2>The Builder</h2>
    <p>At Cart.com, there was no partnerships team. So I built one. I worked across departments — legal, marketing, sales — to build the systems, structure, and strategy. We signed PayPal, Coinbase, Klaviyo, Avalara, and more. I exceeded quota by 240%. I helped shape how Cart.com goes to market.</p>

    <h2>The Operator</h2>
    <p>My strength is in building things that scale — partner programs, sales systems, and revenue operations. I bring structure to the chaos, empathy to the process, and energy to the team. I don’t just close deals — I build engines.</p>
