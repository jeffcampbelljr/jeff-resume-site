  <h2 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: red;">The Spark</h2>
  <p>I was a Senior Account Executive at Capital One, working on the AmeriCommerce platform during its ownership. For three years, we operated with the backing of a full sales team and the structure of a Fortune 100 company.</p>
  <p>Then Capital One sold AmeriCommerce.</p>
  <p>What remained was a lean but committed core: myself, the last AE, Ed Sturrock, our trusted CEO, Jack Cravy, our VP of Operations, a talented group of developers, and a small but mighty support team. We were scrappy, focused, and determined to rebuild.</p>
  <p>There was no CRM. No sales pipeline. No playbook. So I built it. I rebuilt our Salesforce instance from scratch to automate workflows, assign leads, and create visibility across the team.</p>
  <p>At the same time, I wasn’t just selling, I was forging partnerships with companies like <strong>PayPal, Affirm, ShipStation, and TaxCloud</strong>. I worked directly with their teams to strengthen integrations, negotiate terms, and build co-marketing motions that actually drove revenue.</p>
  <p>That’s when I realized: the fastest way to grow wasn’t just more calls or more emails, it was building the right relationships and systems to scale.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: red;">Revenue Through Relationships</h2>
  <p>As Sales & Partnerships Manager at AmeriCommerce, I owned the entire go-to-market motion, leading inbound and outbound sales while simultaneously building a partner ecosystem that reinforced our revenue strategy.</p>
  <p>I rebuilt our Salesforce instance from the ground up, introducing lead routing, pipeline visibility, and automated workflows that supported faster response times and higher conversion rates.</p>
  <p>At the same time, I developed partnerships with companies like <strong>PayPal, Affirm, ShipStation, and TaxCloud</strong>, strengthening integrations, co-marketing, and monetized relationships. These partners not only increased product value — they also became a growing source of referral business.</p>
  <p>This dual engine of <strong>sales and partnerships</strong> helped us grow a niche platform into a highly competitive offering, and contributed directly to year-over-year revenue gains.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: red;">Scaling at Cart.com</h2>
  <p>When AmeriCommerce was acquired by Cart.com, I joined as one of its earliest team members, stepping in as <strong>Sales Manager for the Storefront division</strong> while the company was still under 50 employees.</p>
  <p>Between 2021 and 2024, I was promoted twice, first to <strong>Senior Partner Manager</strong>, then to <strong>Director of Strategic Partnerships & Business Development</strong>, as Cart.com scaled to over 1,000 employees and raised significant funding.</p>
  <p>I helped build the partnerships function from scratch, collaborating with legal, sales, and marketing to create frameworks that were repeatable and revenue-focused. We signed and scaled partner relationships with <strong>PayPal, Klaviyo, Coinbase, Attentive, and Avalara</strong> — building co-sell, co-market, and enablement plays that helped fuel our rapid customer acquisition. These partnerships became a meaningful driver of our pipeline and brand credibility as we grew.</p>
  <p>I was also one of the go-to leaders for onboarding and cross-team collaboration, helping train new hires, support exec alignment, and champion our core values as a founding member of the <strong>Culture Committee</strong>.</p>
  <p>By the end of my time, I was leading all partnerships and sales efforts for the eCommerce division, trusted not just to close deals, but to build the strategy around them.</p>
