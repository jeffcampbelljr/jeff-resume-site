    <h2>The Spark</h2>
    <p>I was hired at Capital One and placed on the AmeriCommerce team during its ownership phase. When Capital One decided to divest AmeriCommerce, everything changed. We were suddenly a standalone company again — leaner, untested, and full of potential. I became the only person in sales. No CRM. No pipeline. No fallback. Just a belief in our product and a drive to build. I listened to customers, leaned into integration gaps, and realized that the fastest way to scale wasn't just selling — it was unlocking partnerships.</p>
    <div class="quote">“Jeff is a powerhouse in connecting with people, building trust, and translating technical strategy into scalable impact.”<br><span>— Lance LaRue, Director, Capital One</span></div>

  <section class="chapter dark" data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>Revenue Through Relationships</h2>
    <p>At AmeriCommerce, I built a Salesforce instance from scratch, closed a deal that brought over 9,000 stores, and led the initiative to make PayPal our preferred payment partner — significantly increasing revenue through payments and monetized integrations.</p>
    <div class="quote">“Jeff helped us build and sell AmeriCommerce and launch Cart.com. Strategic, technical, and deeply trustworthy.”<br><span>— Ed Sturrock, CEO, AmeriCommerce</span></div>

  <section class="chapter" data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>Scaling with a Team at Cart.com</h2>
    <p>At Cart.com, I helped build the partnerships function with an amazing team. We signed PayPal, Coinbase, Klaviyo, Attentive, and Avalara. We built GTM plays, onboarding, and sales enablement to drive measurable impact — I exceeded quota by 240%.</p>
    <div class="quote">“Jeff is a fantastic partner. He has the technical chops and empathy to make things happen across organizations.”<br><span>— Ian Leslie, CMO, Pipe17</span></div>
    <div class="quote">“Jeff is a true operator. He delivers with integrity and empathy. It’s rare to find both.”<br><span>— Scott Staupe, VP Alliances</span></div>

    <h2>Owning Sales & Partnerships</h2>
    <p>By the end of my time at Cart.com, I was running all Sales and Partnerships for the eCommerce division — leading outbound strategy, AE management, referral pipelines, partner deals, and strategic alignment across departments.</p>
    <div class="quote">“Jeff has this ability to rally the right people to the right priorities. He’s part leader, part integrator.”<br><span>— Jack Cravy, COO, Cart.com</span></div>
    <div class="quote">“Jeff was a steady hand through a time of growth, transition, and change. He was never just doing a job — he was helping us define it.”<br><span>— Laura Colagrande, Bloomreach</span></div>
