    <h2>The Spark</h2>
    <p>I was hired at Capital One and placed on the AmeriCommerce team during its ownership phase. When Capital One decided to divest AmeriCommerce, everything changed. We became a standalone company — leaner, untested, and full of potential. I became the only person in sales. No CRM. No pipeline. No fallback. Just belief in our product and a drive to build. I listened to customers, leaned into integration gaps, and discovered that scaling meant more than selling — it meant building partnerships.</p>

    <h2>Revenue Through Relationships</h2>
    <p>At AmeriCommerce, I built a Salesforce instance from scratch, closed a partner deal that brought over 9,000 stores, and led the initiative to make PayPal our preferred payment partner — significantly increasing revenue through payments and monetized integrations.</p>

    <h2>Scaling with a Team at Cart.com</h2>
    <p>At Cart.com, I helped build the partnerships function with an amazing team. We signed PayPal, Coinbase, Klaviyo, Attentive, and Avalara. We built GTM plays, onboarding flows, and sales enablement that drove real revenue — and I exceeded quota by 240%.</p>

    <h2>Owning Sales & Partnerships</h2>
    <p>By the end of my time at Cart.com, I was leading all Sales and Partnerships for the eCommerce division — managing outbound strategy, AE performance, referral pipelines, partner deals, and aligning teams across the company.</p>
